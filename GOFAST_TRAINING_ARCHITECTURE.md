# TrainingMVP Architecture Document

## Current State Analysis

### Overview
The `trainingmvp` repository is a self-contained Next.js 14 training module that provides a complete training plan management system. Authentication and onboarding are now implemented, mirroring the `gofastapp-mvp` pattern.

### Current Architecture

#### 1. **Authentication Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED**

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ Firebase authentication (client + admin)
- ✅ User session management with Firebase tokens
- ✅ Auth guards on protected routes
- ✅ Server-side token verification
- ✅ Secure API routes (athleteId from token, not query params)

**Code Locations:**
- `lib/firebase.ts` - Firebase client initialization
- `lib/firebaseAdmin.ts` - Firebase admin (server-side token verification)
- `lib/auth.ts` - Client-side auth helpers (signInWithGoogle, getToken)
- `app/api/athlete/create/route.ts` - Upsert athlete by Firebase ID
- `app/api/athlete/hydrate/route.ts` - Hydrate athlete data
- `app/signup/page.tsx` - Firebase Google/Email sign-in
- `app/page.tsx` - Splash screen with auth state check
- `app/training/page.tsx` - Auth guard + onboarding check

**Flow:**
1. User signs in with Google/Email → Firebase auth
2. Get Firebase token → call `/api/athlete/create` (upsert)
3. Check if athlete has completed onboarding (`myTargetRace` field)
4. Route to `/onboarding` if new, `/training` if completed
5. Server-side: verify Firebase token → get athleteId from database

#### 2. **Training Plan Setup Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (as "onboarding")**

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ Multi-step setup flow (`/onboarding` - needs rename to `/training-setup`)
- ✅ Collects race information (name, type, goal time, current 5K)
- ✅ Calculates goal pace automatically
- ✅ OpenAI-powered inference generation
- ✅ Saves setup data to Athlete and Race tables
- ⚠️ **TODO**: Create training plan automatically after setup

**Code Locations:**
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` - 3-step setup UI (needs rename)
- `app/api/onboarding/inference/route.ts` - OpenAI inference generation (needs move)
- `app/api/onboarding/save/route.ts` - Save setup data (needs move)
- `lib/utils/pace.ts` - Goal pace calculation utilities

**Setup Flow:**
1. **Step 1 - Form**: Race name, race type, goal time, current 5K pace
   - Goal pace automatically calculated from goal time and race distance
2. **Step 2 - Dialogue**: 
   - "How well do you feel you did your last race?"
   - "Have you trained before?"
3. **Step 3 - Review**: 
   - Shows collected data
   - Displays AI-generated inference
   - Save button to persist to database
   - **TODO**: Auto-create training plan after save

**Data Saved:**
- `Athlete.myTargetRace` - Race name
- `Athlete.myTrainingGoal` - Goal time
- `Athlete.myCurrentPace` - Current 5K pace per mile
- `Race` record created/found in database
- **Missing**: Auto-create `TrainingPlan` and `TrainingDayPlanned` records

#### 3. **Local Storage: ✅ IMPLEMENTED**

**Current State:**
- ✅ localStorage API (`lib/localstorage.ts`)
- ✅ Athlete data persistence
- ✅ Hydration mechanism
- ✅ Caches athlete data between sessions

**Implementation:**
- `LocalStorageAPI.setAthlete()` - Store athlete data
- `LocalStorageAPI.getAthlete()` - Retrieve athlete data
- `LocalStorageAPI.setHydrationTimestamp()` - Track hydration freshness
- Used throughout app for quick access to athlete data

#### 3. **Lib Structure: ⚠️ NEEDS REORGANIZATION BY DOMAIN**

**Current Structure (Needs Refactoring):**
```
lib/
  prisma.ts              ✅ Basic Prisma client
  firebase.ts            ✅ Firebase client initialization
  firebaseAdmin.ts       ✅ Firebase admin (server-side)
  auth.ts                ✅ Client-side Firebase auth helpers
  localstorage.ts        ✅ LocalStorage API
  domain-athlete.ts      ✅ Athlete domain functions
  api.ts                 ✅ API client with token injection
  api-helpers.ts         ✅ Server-side auth helpers
  services/
    analysis.ts          ✅ GoFastScore computation
    extraction.ts        ✅ OpenAI extraction
    match-logic.ts        ✅ Garmin matching (should move to activity-matching)
    plan-generator.ts    ✅ AI plan generation (should move to training-setup)
  utils/
    dates.ts             ✅ Date utilities
    pace.ts              ✅ Pace calculations (includes goal pace calc)
```

**Proposed Structure (By Domain):**
```

  # Core Infrastructure
  prisma.ts
  firebase.ts
  firebaseAdmin.ts
  auth.ts
  localstorage.ts
  domain-athlete.ts
  api.ts
  api-helpers.ts
  
  # Domain 1: Training Plan Setup

- ❌ `lib/training-execution/` - Execution tracking domain
- ❌ `lib/activity-matching/` - Activity matching domain (separate from execution)
- ❌ `lib/training-review/` - Weekly review domain

#### 4. **API Route Pattern: ✅ IMPLEMENTED**

**Current Pattern:**
```typescript
// app/api/training/hub/route.ts
import { getAthleteIdFromRequest } from '@/lib/api-helpers';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const athleteId = await getAthleteIdFromRequest(request);
  // Use athleteId for queries...
}
```

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Auth token verification via `getAthleteIdFromRequest()`
- ✅ Server-side athlete resolution from Firebase token
- ✅ Secure - no client-passed athleteId
- ✅ No test ID fallback

**Auth Helper:**
```typescript
// lib/api-helpers.ts
export async function getAthleteIdFromRequest(request: NextRequest) {
  const token = request.headers.get('authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
  if (!token) throw new Error('No auth token');
  const decoded = await verifyFirebaseIdToken(token);
  const athlete = await getAthleteByFirebaseId(decoded.uid);
  return athlete.id;
}
```

#### 5. **Page Components: ✅ AUTH CHECKS IMPLEMENTED**

**Current Flow:**
1. `app/page.tsx` (splash) → checks Firebase auth state → routes to `/signup` or `/training`
2. `app/signup/page.tsx` → Firebase Google/Email sign-in → creates/upserts athlete → routes based on onboarding status
3. `app/onboarding/page.tsx` → collects race info → generates inference → saves data
4. `app/training/page.tsx` → auth guard + onboarding check → redirects if needed → loads training data

**Auth Guards:**
- ✅ Firebase auth state checked on all protected routes
- ✅ Redirects to `/signup` if not authenticated
- ✅ Redirects to `/onboarding` if onboarding incomplete
- ✅ Uses athleteId from authenticated user

## Architecture: Separated Concerns

The training system is organized into four distinct domains, each with its own UX flow and data processing:

### 1. Training Plan Setup
**Purpose**: Collect athlete goals and preferences, then generate a personalized training plan.

**Flow:**
1. User provides race information (name, type, date)
2. User provides goal time and current fitness (5K pace)
3. User answers dialogue questions about experience
4. OpenAI generates personalized insights
5. System creates training plan from inputs
6. Plan saved to database with all planned workouts

**Key Data:**
- Race information (name, type, date, distance)
- Goal time and calculated goal pace
- Current 5K pace (baseline fitness)
- Training experience and preferences
- OpenAI inference/insights

**Database:**
- `Athlete` fields: `myTargetRace`, `myTrainingGoal`, `myCurrentPace`
- `Race` record
- `TrainingPlan` record
- `TrainingDayPlanned` records (all days)

**Files:**
- `app/training-setup/page.tsx` - Setup UI (formerly onboarding)
- `app/api/training-setup/inference/route.ts` - OpenAI insights
- `app/api/training-setup/save/route.ts` - Save setup data
- `app/api/training-setup/create-plan/route.ts` - Generate & save plan
- `lib/training-setup.ts` - Setup logic
- `lib/services/plan-generator.ts` - OpenAI plan generation

### 2. Training Plan Execution
**Purpose**: Track daily workout completion and progress through the plan.

**Flow:**
1. User views today's planned workout
2. User completes workout (manual entry or activity match)
3. System marks workout as executed
4. System tracks progress metrics
5. System updates adaptive metrics based on performance

**Key Data:**
- Planned workouts (`TrainingDayPlanned`)
- Executed workouts (`TrainingDayExecuted`)
- Completion status
- Progress metrics (weeks completed, workouts done)
- Weekly mileage actual vs planned

**Database:**
- `TrainingDayPlanned` - What should be done
- `TrainingDayExecuted` - What was done
- Links to `AthleteActivity` (if matched)

**Files:**
- `app/training-execution/page.tsx` - Today's workout view
- `app/training-execution/day/[dayId]/page.tsx` - Specific day view
- `app/api/training-execution/day/[dayId]/route.ts` - Get/update day
- `app/api/training-execution/complete/route.ts` - Mark as complete
- `lib/training-execution.ts` - Execution tracking logic
- `lib/services/analysis.ts` - Performance analysis

### 3. Activity Matching
**Purpose**: Separate UX for Garmin users to sync and match activities to planned workouts.

**Flow:**
1. User connects Garmin account (separate flow)
2. Garmin activities sync to `AthleteActivity` table
3. User views unmatched activities
4. User manually matches activity to planned workout OR
5. System auto-matches based on date/time proximity
6. Activity linked to `TrainingDayExecuted`

**Key Data:**
- `AthleteActivity` records from Garmin
- Unmatched activities list
- Matching suggestions
- Manual match confirmation

**Database:**
- `AthleteActivity` - Raw Garmin data
- `TrainingDayExecuted.activityId` - Link to activity
- Garmin connection metadata on `Athlete`

**Files:**
- `app/activity-matching/page.tsx` - Unmatched activities view
- `app/activity-matching/match/[activityId]/page.tsx` - Match activity to workout
- `app/api/activity-matching/sync/route.ts` - Sync from Garmin
- `app/api/activity-matching/unmatched/route.ts` - Get unmatched
- `app/api/activity-matching/match/route.ts` - Match activity to day
- `lib/activity-matching.ts` - Matching logic
- `lib/services/match-logic.ts` - Auto-match algorithms

### 4. Training Plan Athlete Review
**Purpose**: Weekly feedback mechanism for athletes to review progress and get insights.

**Flow:**
1. System generates weekly review (end of week)
2. User views weekly summary
3. Shows: workouts completed, mileage, pace trends
4. Shows: adaptive 5K time updates
5. Shows: race readiness status
6. Shows: AI-generated feedback and recommendations
7. User can provide feedback on the week

**Key Data:**
- Weekly aggregates (mileage, workouts, pace)
- Adaptive metrics (5K time, goal delta)
- Race readiness score
- Weekly feedback from athlete
- AI-generated weekly insights

**Database:**
- Aggregated from `TrainingDayExecuted`
- `TrainingPlan.trainingPlanAdaptive5kTime` - Updated weekly
- Weekly review records (future table)

**Files:**
- `app/training-review/weekly/page.tsx` - Weekly review view
- `app/training-review/weekly/[weekIndex]/page.tsx` - Specific week
- `app/api/training-review/weekly/[weekIndex]/route.ts` - Get weekly data
- `app/api/training-review/feedback/route.ts` - Submit feedback
- `lib/training-review.ts` - Review generation logic
- `lib/services/analysis.ts` - Adaptive metrics calculation

**Training Plan Structure:**
- **TrainingPlan**: Top-level plan with goal time, baseline 5K, total weeks, status
- **TrainingDayPlanned**: Individual workout days with plannedData (JSON)
  - Each day has: type, mileage, paceRange, hrZone, description, etc.
  - Organized by weekIndex and dayIndex
  - Phases: base, build, peak, taper

### Domain Separation Summary

**1. Training Plan Setup** → Creates the plan
- Input: Race info, goals, preferences
- Output: `TrainingPlan` + all `TrainingDayPlanned` records
- UX: Multi-step form → AI insights → Plan generation

**2. Training Plan Execution** → Tracks daily workouts
- Input: Planned workouts, completion status
- Output: `TrainingDayExecuted` records, progress metrics
- UX: Today's workout view, mark complete, track progress

**3. Activity Matching** → Separate Garmin sync flow
- Input: Garmin activities (`AthleteActivity`)
- Output: Matched activities linked to `TrainingDayExecuted`
- UX: Unmatched activities list, manual/auto matching

**4. Training Plan Athlete Review** → Weekly feedback
- Input: Weekly execution data, adaptive metrics
- Output: Weekly summary, AI feedback, race readiness
- UX: Weekly review page, progress visualization, feedback form

## Complete User Flow

### Authentication & Onboarding Flow
```
1. User visits app → Splash screen
2. Check Firebase auth state
   ├─ Not authenticated → /signup
   └─ Authenticated → Check onboarding
       ├─ No myTargetRace → /onboarding
       └─ Has myTargetRace → /training
3. Signup → Firebase auth → /api/athlete/create (upsert)
4. Onboarding → Collect race info → OpenAI inference → Save to DB
5. Training → Auth guard → Onboarding check → Load training data
```

### Training Plan Creation Flow
```
1. User completes onboarding
   ├─ Athlete.myTargetRace = "Boston Marathon"
   ├─ Athlete.myTrainingGoal = "3:30:00"

```typescript
// lib/training-setup/index.ts
export { validateSetupComplete } from './validate';
export { createTrainingPlanFromSetup } from './create-plan';
export { generateSetupInference } from './inference';

// lib/training-setup/create-plan.ts
export async function createTrainingPlanFromSetup(athleteId: string): Promise<string> {
  // 1. Validate setup complete
  // 2. Get athlete + race data
  // 3. Build TrainingInputs
  // 4. Call OpenAI plan generation
  // 5. Save to database

export async function markWorkoutComplete(
  athleteId: string,
  plannedDayId: string,
  manualData?: { distance?: number; duration?: number; pace?: string }
): Promise<TrainingDayExecuted> {
  // Create TrainingDayExecuted (no activityId for manual entry)
  // Trigger analysis
}
```

**API Routes:**

  // Aggregate weekly data
  // Calculate metrics
  // Generate AI feedback
}
```

**API Routes:**
- `app/api/training-review/weekly/[weekIndex]/route.ts` - Get weekly review
- `app/api/training-review/feedback/route.ts` - Submit feedback

**Move Existing:**
- `lib/services/analysis.ts` → Split between `training-execution/progress.ts` and `training-review/metrics.ts`

## Database Schema Notes

The Prisma schema in trainingmvp already has:
- `Athlete` model with `firebaseId` field (line 15)
- Proper relations to training plans, activities, etc.

**This is good!** The schema is ready for Firebase auth integration.

## Environment Variables Needed

```bash
# Firebase Client
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=

# Firebase Admin (Server-side)
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=  # JSON string

# Database
DATABASE_URL=

# OpenAI (existing)
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Remove this:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_ATHLETE_ID=  # DELETE THIS
```

## Summary

### Current State ✅
- ✅ **Authentication**: Firebase auth (client + admin) implemented
- ✅ **Onboarding**: Multi-step flow with OpenAI inference
- ✅ **LocalStorage**: Athlete data persistence
- ✅ **API Security**: Server-side token verification, secure routes
- ✅ **Auth Flow**: Signup → Onboarding → Training
- ✅ **Training Features**: Hub, plan, day, match (existing)
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Correct structure with relations
- ✅ **Services**: Analysis, extraction, match-logic, plan-generator

### What's Missing ⚠️
- ⚠️ **Domain Separation**: Need to refactor into 4 distinct domains
- ⚠️ **Training Setup Domain**: Refactor "onboarding" → "training-setup", add auto plan creation
- ⚠️ **Training Execution Domain**: Separate execution tracking from activity matching
- ⚠️ **Activity Matching Domain**: Separate UX/process for Garmin sync and matching
- ⚠️ **Training Review Domain**: Weekly feedback mechanism not yet implemented

### Priority Actions

#### Completed ✅
1. ✅ Add Firebase auth lib files
2. ✅ Update signup to actually authenticate
3. ✅ Add localStorage API
4. ✅ Update API routes to use token verification
5. ✅ Add auth guards to pages
6. ✅ Implement onboarding flow
7. ✅ Add goal pace calculation

#### Next Steps 🔄
1. **HIGH**: Refactor "onboarding" → "training-setup" (rename folders/files)
2. **HIGH**: Create `lib/training-setup/` domain with auto plan creation
3. **HIGH**: Create `lib/training-execution/` domain (separate from matching)
4. **HIGH**: Create `lib/activity-matching/` domain (separate UX/process)
5. **MEDIUM**: Create `lib/training-review/` domain for weekly feedback
6. **MEDIUM**: Reorganize API routes by domain
7. **LOW**: Add ability to edit setup data
8. **LOW**: Add race date picker to setup

### Architecture Status

**Authentication & Setup: ✅ COMPLETE (needs rename)**
- Firebase auth working
- Setup flow complete (currently called "onboarding")
- Data saved to database
- Auth guards in place
- ⚠️ Needs: Auto-create plan after setup

**Domain Separation: ⚠️ NEEDS REFACTORING**
- **Training Setup**: ✅ Exists but needs rename and auto-plan creation
- **Training Execution**: ⚠️ Exists but mixed with matching - needs separation
- **Activity Matching**: ⚠️ Exists but mixed with execution - needs separate domain
- **Training Review**: ❌ Not yet implemented - needs creation

**Recommended Folder Structure:**
```
app/
  training-setup/          (rename from onboarding)
  training-execution/
  activity-matching/
  training-review/

app/api/
  training-setup/          (rename from onboarding)
